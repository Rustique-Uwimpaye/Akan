        <h1>Akan people</h1>
        <p>The Akan are a meta-ethnicity living in the southern regions of present-day Ghana and Ivory Coast in West Africa. The Akan language (also known as Twi/Fante) is a group of dialects within the Central Tano branch of the Potou–Tano subfamily of the Niger–Congo family.</p>
        <h2>Subgroups of the Akan people include:</h2>   
        <ul>
            <li>Agona</li>
            <li>Akuapem</li>
            <li>Akwamu</li>
            <li>Akyem</li>
            <li>Ashanti</li>
            <li>Bono</li>
            <li>Fante</li>
            <li>Kwahu</li>
            <li>Wassa</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Akan culture can also be found in the Americas, where a number of Akans were taken as captives. Roughly ten percent of all slave ships that embarked from the Gold Coast contained Akan people. The primary source of wealth in the Akan economy was gold. However, the capture and sale of Akan people peaked during the Fante and Ashanti conflicts (as both sold many of their captives as prisoners of war). Akan conflicts led to a high number of military captives, known as "Coromantee", being sold into slavery. The Coromantee soldiers and other Akan captives were notorious for various slave revolts and plantation resistance tactics. These captives were feared throughout America. Their legacy is evident within groups such as the Maroons of the Caribbean and South America.</p>

        <p><b>Origin and ethnogenesis</b>: Akan people are believed to have migrated to their current location from the Sahara desert and Sahel regions of Africa into the forest region around the 11th century. Many Akans tell their history as it started in the eastern region of Africa as this is where the ethnogenesis of the Akan as we know them today happened.
        Oral traditions of the ruling Abrade (Aduana) clan state that Akans originated from the ancient Ghana empire. The Akan people migrated from the north through Egypt and settled in Nubia. Around 500 AD (5th century), due to pressure exerted by the Axumite kingdom of Ethiopia, Nubia was shattered and the Akan people moved west and established small trading kingdoms. These kingdoms grew and around 750 AD the Ghana Empire was formed. </p>
